    text: "Captain: Stay away from the river! That water is deadly to us.\nAssistant:
      But it looks like there\u2019s no other way forward.\nRecorder: I just received
      a photo from the Professor\u2014she captured a turtle drinking the water. It
      seems harmless to the native creatures. Maybe we can use that to our advantage.\nCaptain:
      The turtle... Haha, I\u2019ve got an idea. Assistant, let\u2019s go back and
      grab some of its favorite fruit.\nAssistant: I get it! The carrot and the stick!"
