    text: "Assistant: Calling the ship! Calling the ship! Do you copy?\nRecorder:
      Ship here, go ahead.\nAssistant: The Professor got swallowed! She was just
      examining some plants by the shore, and suddenly a huge fish burst out from
      underground and ate her whole!\nRecorder: Oh no\u2026 Don\u2019t panic. Please
      head back to the ship for now.\nAssistant: But I don\u2019t even know how to
      get back\u2026 We never found a way to climb back up the cliff.\nAssistant:
      \u2026 I\u2019m going after her. That fish must\u2019ve come from some kind
      of underground tunnel.\nRecorder: Wait! That\u2019s way too dangerous!\nAssistant:
      If I had something as tough as that turtle\u2019s shell, maybe I wouldn\u2019t
      even be afraid of getting swallowed.\nRecorder: But we can\u2019t exactly remove
      the turtle\u2019s shell\u2026 Hold on\u2014according to your scan data, the
      shell of that scallop by the shore is made of the same material as the turtle\u2019s.\nRecorder:
      And scallop shells are much easier to get.\nAssistant: You\u2019re a genius!
      Thanks for the tip\u2014I\u2019m taking the risk."
