      you find the Professor?\nAssistant: Unfortunately... no.\nAssistant: Looks
      like I was taken to the fish\u2019s lair. It couldn\u2019t digest this hard
      shell, so it spat me out.\nRecorder: That\u2019s incredible... Can you guess
      where you are now?"

      Please take a photo for the record.\nAssistant: Got it! I wish I could float
      around in the air like them\u2026\nProfessor: Alright, calm down. Let\u2019s
      assess our current situation: we need to find a way down the cliff.\nRecorder:
      Professor, can you hear me?\nProfessor: Go ahead.\nRecorder: The captain told
      me earlier how to get down. It involves using those... things in the sky.\nRecorder: 
      First, you need to find some yellow fruit nearby, and then\u2026\nProfessor:
      No need to say more\u2014I know what to do. That guy sure has an imagination.\nAssistant:
      The gravity here feels about the same as New Earth. So boring!"

      no\u2026 Let me think.\nProfessor: Stay calm. The rover still works \u2014

      dangerous to go alone!\nProfessor: No objections from me.\nCaptain: We still
      have the recorder to keep us connected. The ship\u2019s failure was my responsibility.
      I\u2019ll find us fuel.\nRecorder: I\u2019ll sync all your collected data to
      the log system. Don\u2019t forget to check your tablets."
