    text: "Assistant: Hey, I want to go lie down on the mountaintop. Want to come?\nRecorder:
      Sure.\nAssistant: It\u2019s kind of ironic, huh? After searching for over 10
      days, we\u2019ve come full circle\u2026 and the Professor is still\u2026\nRecorder:
      I\u2019m really sad too\u2026 but at least there\u2019s still hope. The Captain\u2019s
      still out there looking for a way, right?\nAssistant: I\u2019m afraid the Captain\u2019s
      the one taking it the hardest\u2026 after all, she was his ex-wife.\nRecorder:
      Wait\u2026 huh???\nAssistant: Oh, you didn\u2019t know?\nRecorder: How is that
      possible? The Professor always acted so cold toward him!\nAssistant: That\u2019s
      why she\u2019s the ex-wife. But I could still feel a connection between them.\nRecorder:
      I just can\u2019t imagine it\u2026 those two seemed worlds apart.\nAssistant:
      The Captain still has feelings for her. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have taken
      such a huge risk piloting this ship."
